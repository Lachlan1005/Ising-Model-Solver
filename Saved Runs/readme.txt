===SAVED RUNS README===
In this folder are some saved runs of the simulation. 
The ones with "FullRun" designations are ones that has reached an equilibrium configuration. Usually in this state all the spins are aligned, 
but there are exceptions such as the case in N=25_ising2D_FullRun2.mp4

---T-Dependendce---
When the temperature parameter T=0, true equilibrium occurs when all spins are aligned. However, for anything above that, equilibrium can occur without all spins aligning. 
If the temperature is below some critical temperature threshold yet nonzero, equilibrium will occur with partial order in the spins.
